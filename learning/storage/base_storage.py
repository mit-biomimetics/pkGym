""" Store data for different loop
Design consideration: change the original "has-a" relationship of
LT->rollout->transition to parallel. Transition stores all the needed data for
every step and will be cleared/updated every step and passed to rollout and
longterm Rollout store data for every iteration, generate batch for learning
Longterm stores needed data from transition, and probably also generate batches
