# MIT Humanoid URDFs

### Naming convention:
F: Full collision boxes (each link gets a collision box)
R: Reduced collision boxes (only feet, body, and hands get a collision box)
sf: single-foot (one collision box for the entire foot)
ht: heel-toe (two collision boxes for each foot)

### Notes
- colors don't seem to get rendered
- visualization is _a lot_ faster with just the collision boxes.
